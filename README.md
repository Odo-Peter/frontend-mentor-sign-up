## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

This challenge has taught me the importance of a proper markup and the power of CSS, alongside media queries, also, learnt about the placeholder pseudo element in CSS and further implementing it with JavaScript.

The challenge has also improved my knowledge, in terms of using markdown files and in committing a file to github, basically working with the command line has improved some more, all thanks to this and other frontend mentor's challenge worked on.

### Continued development

In future projects or challenges, I'ld love to add more javascript functions that will toggle the color scheme, to probably a dark and light mode.
